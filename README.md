# XrayIcFromScratch
Pediatric Xray Image Classification using CNN from scratch
Makes use of curated X-ray Image dataset to train a CNN model using the TensorFlow platform
As it is a binary classification problem, the corresponding CNN parameters are adjusted to suit accordingly (Final layer activation with 'sigmoid', Binary cross-entropy as the loss function) 
Data augmentation using ImageDataGenerator class from Keras
Model able to demonstrate a testing accuracy > 90%
